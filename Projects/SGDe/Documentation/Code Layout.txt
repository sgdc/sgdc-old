SGDe is laied out so that subsystems are in their own namespaces. Code is self-documenting, so function names, fields, 
properties, and classes are named for what they do (with the exception of Physics which is partially named for inside jokes).
Public functions are documented and use basic language to make it easy to understand. All code is flexible and able to run
with or without the built-in content system, meaning that it can be used as a standard XNA game or as a SGDe game that uses
the content system to make game creation easier. No functions or classes should be half-baked and only have some of their
code implemented. Everything is functional and useable.
